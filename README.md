We all have different moods.  We all want to be understood.  This application lets you choose how you feel, and will show you GIFs similar to how you feel, and give you a famous quote.  We aren't trying to make you feel better, we just want you to know it's "OK"-but if it helps lighten your day, then that's fine too!

MoodToolBox is an application where you can click one of 18 different emojis corresponding to how you feel, and the application will return GIFs similar to the mood you are feeling and return a famous quote for you.
The application uses Carousel to display the emojis, and opens a new page for display of the GIFS and quote.  The GIFs can be paused and restarted with a click.
Behind the scenes, the application is making two API calls, one from Giphy and one from They Said So.  
The page can be reset, if the user has a change in mood!
